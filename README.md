# Capacitive-MIDI-Controller

In this fun project I build myself a MIDI controller based on the ESP32. I use the built-in touch sensors of the board to make touch sensitive pads that can trigger samples on any DAW.
Along the way I added some potentiometers to get more control in my DAW, as well as an octave selection toggle switch.
In the future I plan on adding BLE capabilities to use the controller on my phone in the train or the plane!
