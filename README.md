# Capacitive-MIDI-Controller

In this fun project I build myself a MIDI controller based on the ESP32. I use the built-in touch sensors of the board to make touch sensitive pads that can trigger samples on any DAW.
Along the way I added some potentiometers to get more control in my DAW, as well as an octave selection toggle switch.
In the future I plan on adding BLE capabilities to use the controller on my phone in the train or the plane!

In this repository you'll find some steps in my journey, and maybe some new ideas for your personnal projects!

Special thanks to my great friend Rohit Tantiya (RolandThsive on GH) who's helped me a lot with correcting and printing my designs for the housing.
